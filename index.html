      After graduating High School, Derek took a one year drafting course at Wake Tech. He started out working on CAD systems and developed a career doing contract-type work. Derek has worked in North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina and Texas. The thing he learned from that, is companies want someone to come in being productive and learn company processes quickly. The lessons Derek learned from that he would like to apply to a new career in web development.
